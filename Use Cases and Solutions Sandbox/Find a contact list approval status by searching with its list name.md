# Problem Statement

You want to find the contact list approval status by searching with its contact list name.
examples of contact list data details [link](https://www.benchmarkemail.com/models.htm#ContactFullRecord)

---

## Prerequisites

1. A free or paid Benchmark Email account. It will have your secured API token.  [link](https://ui.benchmarkemail.com/Integrate#AP)
1. Always use host of: `https://clientapi.benchmarkemail.com`
1. An HTTP library or HTTP app, such as postman [link](https://www.getpostman.com/), to make API calls

## Solution

<sub>using the Benchmark API v3.0 RESTful endpoints. All our RESTful endpoints documentation found on [web](https://developer.benchmarkemail.com/) or [github](https://github.com/BenchmarkEmail/RESTful-API-v3/tree/master/Postman%20Collections)></sub>

1. Secure your request by placing your Benchmark Email API Token, see prerequisite #1 above, in the header of your request.

```javascript
// example of headers from a python3 request

headers = {
    'AuthToken': "YOUR_BENCHMARK_EMAIL_API_TOKEN_HERE",
    'Content-Type': "application/json" 
}

// application/json is used for all GET requests
```

2. Make a request to search for the contact list [link](https://developer.benchmarkemail.com/#cc3ee91a-0ccb-79c1-9365-c96f8511a68b). The response body will provide the list details if it finds the list queried [link](https://www.benchmarkemail.com/models.htm#ContactFullRecord).

```js
    GET /Contact/?SearchFilter={{SearchFilter}}
    //where {{SearchFilter}} will be replaced with all or part of your contact list name.
    //in the response body find Resonse.Data[1..n].Status for the respective list name
```

## Validate Response from Server

1. Confirm the response provides
    1. a status of 200 OK 
    1. the response body does NOT contain a value of -1 for Response.Status
    1. Confirm Response.Status value is 1.
